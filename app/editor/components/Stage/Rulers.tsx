 * Rulers stub component
 *
 * The original codebase defined an empty file here.  CanvasEngine will
 * automatically manage its own ruler canvases when provided with the
 * appropriate DOM elements.  If you wish to extract the rulers into their
 * own React component you can do so by rendering four <canvas> elements and
 * passing their refs into CanvasEngine.  For now this stub exists simply
 * to satisfy the import path without causing runtime errors.
