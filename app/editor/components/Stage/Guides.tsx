 * Guides stub component
 *
 * Smart guides and snapping lines are a useful UX enhancement but the
 * previous repository contained no implementation.  This stub avoids
 * import errors and can be fleshed out in the future to render guide
 * overlays on top of the canvas when aligning objects.  Currently it
 * returns nothing so that the canvas remains fully functional.
